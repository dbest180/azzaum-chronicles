# What If Humanity Was Never Alone?

What if the myths about "the tall ones" who taught us fire weren't metaphors? What if beings who never aged really did walk among early humans—guiding, teaching, watching?
What if we betrayed them?

AZZAUM (pronounced AZ-um) is the first of The Ancients—biologically immortal beings who emerged in the Rift Valley and integrated with early mankind. They possessed dense physiology that healed catastrophic wounds, extraordinary strength, and perfect memory. They appeared god-like to primitive humans, but they saw themselves simply as "The Ones Who Stayed."

For millennia, they guided humanity's evolution. Then came the betrayal.
The strongest Ancient—Deidriss—was struck down by one of his own kind and fragmented by humans into five pieces, scattered across continents to suppress his consciousness. The remaining Ancients withdrew into shadow. And a parasitic human elite discovered that consuming Ancient blood grants extended life—at the cost of biological addiction.

Today, the fragments are hidden in museums, corporate bio-labs, and military black sites. The elite control access, drinking to stay young while suppressing the truth. And AZZAUM—the first, the oldest, the teacher of Ancients—still appears to those who stumble onto secrets they shouldn't know.
My name is Derrick Best, and I've been building this world for years. Now I'm bringing it to life here, one post at a time.

This is speculative fiction exploring biological immortality, hidden history, and the possibility that human myths are garbled memories of something real.
