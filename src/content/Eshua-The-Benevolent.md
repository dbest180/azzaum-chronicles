ESHUA THE BENEVOLENT
**Status:** Canonical Archive // AZZAUM Codex
**Designation:** The Healer / The Resurrected
**Age:** Age of Presence (Middle East / Levant)

THE BIOLOGICAL PHILANTHROPIST
While **Neemahrod** focused on the stone and **Ghenhuas** on the sword, **Eshua** was tasked by Azzaum to master the flesh. His primary trait was an over-developed **Secondary Neural Network**, which granted him "Perceptual Biology"—the ability to sense cellular decay and viral load in others by mere proximity.

He didn't "heal" through magic. He used his unique stem cell colonies (derived from his **Obsidian Marrow**) to trigger rapid recursion in mortals. To the primitive world, this was divine; to Azzaum, it was a dangerous distribution of Ancient resources.

THE LEVANT INCIDENT
Eshua’s capture and public execution were calculated risks. He allowed the event to occur to demonstrate a fundamental truth of the Ancient condition: **The body is a vessel; the Lattice is the record.**

THE THREE-DAY RESET
When Eshua was "seen" three days after his death, it was the first documented case of a **Full System Recursion**. 
1. **Day 1:** The body remains in stasis. The **Neural Lattice** protects the consciousness from "fading."
2. **Day 2:** The **Telomeric Recursion** mechanism draws from the Obsidian Marrow to rebuild damaged tissue.
3. **Day 3:** The "Spark"—the secondary neural network restarts the heart and brain.

## LEGACY OF THE NUDGE
Eshua’s "ascension" was actually his withdrawal. Following the **Great Silence**, he realized that providing immortality to mortals would lead to the very domination Deidriss craved. He vanished into the desert, leaving behind a legacy of "mercy" that would be garbled by human religions for two millennia.
