# LOG_102: NEEMAHROD THE ARCHITECT
**Status:** Canonical Archive // Project Codex
**Designation:** The Builder / The Tower King
**Age:** Age of Presence (Mesopotamia)

## THE MATHEMATICAL CONSTRUCT
Neemahrod was the secondary biological anomaly sent alongside Eshua and Ghenhuas. His **Neural Lattice** was specialized for "Spatial Perceptual Mathematics," allowing him to calculate structural integrity and celestial alignment without tools.

## THE TOWER INCIDENT
His "miracle" was the Tower of Babel. It wasn't a reach for heaven; it was a localized transmitter designed to stabilize the **Ancient fragment signals**. When the First Peoples turned against the benefactors during the **Age of the Veil**, the tower was sabotaged, leading to the **Great Silence** and the withdrawal of Ancient technology from the public eye.

## BIOLOGICAL LEGACY
* **Obsidian Marrow**: Neemahrod possessed the highest bone density recorded among the Rift Valley group, allowing him to survive structural collapses that would crush a mortal.
* **Neural Lattice**: Used to store complex architectural blueprints for millennia without degradation.
