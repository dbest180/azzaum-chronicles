# THE REDFALL INCIDENT
**Status:** Decrypted // Historical Pivot Point
**Location:** The Great Plains (The Cradle)
**Ages:** Transition from Presence to Veil

## THE UNTAMED ANOMALY
Before he was a fragment, **Deidriss** was a storm. Unlike the elder Ancients who emerged with a sense of stewardship, Deidriss was a biological fire. Born in the Cradle of Civilization, he reached maturity without realizing his cells were recursively resetting. To him, the world was a mathematical variable to be solved through absolute dominion.

While **Azzaum (The First)** preached a doctrine of "The Ones Who Stayed"—a peaceful symbiosis with mortal brethren—Deidriss saw the Rift Valley not as a home, but as a starting line. He looked at the stars and calculated empires.

> "A near-immortal human bent on domination can never be quenched. Mortals will burn as fuel before his ambition is contained." — *Azzaum, Neural Log 04*

## THE STRATEGIC DISPERSION
Azzaum, sensing the inevitability of conflict, deployed three specialized Ancients to gather the "perceptual mathematics" of the wider world and prepare humanity for the coming storm:

1.  **Ghenhuas Ka’an:** Sent to the East to master the mathematics of movement and horse-warfare.
2.  **Neemahrod:** Sent to the North to engineer the first grand structures (The Spires).
3.  **Eshua (The Benevolent):** Sent to the Levant. A master of biological stem-cell manipulation (herbalism). His "resurrection" three days after public execution was the first recorded use of the **Neural Lattice** recovery in the Middle East.

## THE BATTLE OF REDFALL
The conflict culminated on the plains of RedFall. Deidriss had raised an army that moved with the precision of a machine. He was no longer a man; he was a god-king who could not be cut, could not be tired, and could not be stopped.

The tide turned not by an army, but by a **The Inhibitor**. 

From the chaos of the front lines, a sword—specifically forged to jam Ancient healing—was flung with the "perceptual accuracy" only an Ancient mind could calculate. It pierced Deidriss's chest, lodging in the **Obsidian Marrow**. 

He did not die. He slumped in the dirt, the biological feedback of the sword stalling his recursion. Looking into the crowd, he didn't see a mortal assassin. He saw the cold, calculating eyes of one of his own kind. 

**The Great Silence began that day.**

### BIOLOGICAL NOTE: THE FIVEFOLD SEPARATION
Following RedFall, it was determined that Deidriss was too powerful to be left whole. To prevent a "Second Rise," his physical form was fragmented into five distinct biological components:
- **The Cranium** (Strategic Intelligence)
- **The Torso** (The Recursive Core)
- **The Appendages** (The Kinetic Strength)

These pieces remain suppressed today, scattered across the globe to prevent reunification.
